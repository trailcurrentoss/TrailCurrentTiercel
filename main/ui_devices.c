 * The dot arc.
 *
 * The dots answer two questions at a glance -- how many devices there are,
 * and which one this is -- so the number SHOWN is the number of devices and
 * the lit one is the selected device. Both change at runtime; the widgets
 * cannot move, because moving an authored widget from C is what makes EEZ
 * Studio's canvas disagree with the panel.
 *
 * They sit on an arc at 6 o'clock, growing outwards from there -- exactly the
 * menu's dot row: same centre, radius and spacing. A row across the face would be
 * bounded by its width and would eventually either run off the glass or shrink
 * until the dots stopped being countable; an arc is not bounded that way.
 *
 * So there are 2*MAX-1 slots at HALF the visible spacing, and a list of n
 * devices lights every OTHER slot starting at slot (MAX - n). Half-spacing
 * slots are what let an EVEN count straddle 6 o'clock and an ODD count sit
 * one dot on it -- one slot per device can only ever centre one of the two,
 * and the other lands half a step round the arc.
 *
 * MAX_DEVICES in GUI/tmp/screens_layout.py authors the arc from the same
 * ceiling, and the generator refuses to write a project where it disagrees
 * with TIERCEL_MAX_CONTROLS -- see check_device_dots(). The assert is the
 * third leg of that: it catches the header changing and the project never
 * being regenerated, which is the case the generator cannot see.
