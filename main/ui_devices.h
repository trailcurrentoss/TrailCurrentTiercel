/*
 * The Devices screen: the carousel of controls Headwaters assigned to this
 * dial.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS AND IS NOT
 *
 * It is content only. The tile, the two neighbour slots, the name, the state
 * word and the row of dots are all authored in EEZ Studio -- see
 * page_devices() in GUI/tmp/screens_layout.py -- and everything here is
 * lv_label_set_text, lv_obj_add_state and LV_OBJ_FLAG_HIDDEN. No geometry,
 * no styles, no widget creation.
 *
 * That is the whole reason this screen was rebuilt. Its previous version
 * created a scrolling list of rows in C with lv_obj_set_pos() and
 * lv_obj_set_size(), so EEZ Studio's canvas showed an empty box where the
 * device rows would be, and nobody could review the one screen users touch
 * most. The carousel shows THREE items whatever the list length, so an
 * unbounded list no longer needs an unbounded number of widgets and the
 * exception that justified building it from code is gone.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL DATA, AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
 *
 *   name, icon   the retained local/config/tiercel/<host>/controls payload,
 *                via tiercel_config -- the user picks both in Headwaters
 *   on / off     local/lights/<id>/status, via tiercel_model
 *
 * The MQTT topics are still `lights`, because that is the platform's
 * contract and renaming a topic on the dial alone would simply stop it
 * talking to the rig. "Devices" is what this dial calls them, which is the
 * only name a user sees.
