/*
 * Alarm evaluation and the alert overlay. See ui_alerts.h.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The alarm contract was built end to end except for its last step. The PWA
 * saved each dial's list, Headwaters published it retained, the dial parsed it
 * and wrote it to NVS -- and then nothing ever read it back.
 * tiercel_alarm_is_active() had no callers and nothing navigated to
 * PageAlert, so a configured alarm could fire all night on a dial that showed
 * the clock. The CO and LPG flags were in the same position: the model
 * header says they raise this overlay, and nothing did.
