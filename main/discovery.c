 * been backed off -- the 1.46" runs at 11 dBm, see

 * first, while the broker connection stays up because TCP retransmits and
 * mDNS does not. Symptom: a panel that is plainly online and simply never
 * appears in Overlook's list.
 *
 * So announce again on a timer. mdns_service_txt_item_set() re-announces
 * unconditionally on every call (mdns_responder.c does not gate on the value
 * having changed), so bumping a counter key is the supported way to ask for
 * one without removing and re-adding the service -- a remove would emit a
 * goodbye packet and could evict us from a host that had just resolved us.
 *

 * mDNS is started per discovery window, NOT at boot.
 *
 * WHY, HONESTLY
 *
 * This is PRECAUTIONARY, not a fix for an observed fault. Read this before
 * changing it, and do not repeat the mistake the first version of this
 * comment made by asserting a cause that had not been established.
 *
 * The broker is reached by an mDNS name -- `mqtts://headwaters.local:8883`.
 * Nothing in this firmware resolves that; lwIP does, through
 * CONFIG_LWIP_DNS_SUPPORT_MDNS_QUERIES, which answers `.local` lookups inside
 * getaddrinfo() by sending its own multicast query. The espressif/mdns
 * component binds UDP 5353 for itself, and the two sharing that port is a
 * known thing to be careful about in ESP-IDF. The component offers no
 * getaddrinfo integration of its own -- no DNS hook, no Kconfig for it.
 *
 * Tiercel is the only TrailCurrent device whose BROKER is addressed by a
 * `.local` name, so it is the only one where that would matter. Fireside and
 * Spotter start mDNS at boot and are fine.
 *
 * Confining mDNS to the window costs nothing and removes the question. The
 * window already stops the broker, so for its duration nothing needs to
 * resolve `.local`; outside it, lwIP has 5353 to itself. A wall panel also has
 * no reason to answer multicast queries except while it is being onboarded.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DID NOT FIX
 *
 * All three boards once sat retrying the broker forever with
 *
 *   E esp-tls: couldn't get hostname for :headwaters.local:
 *              getaddrinfo() returns 202, addrinfo=0x0
 *   E mqtt: TLS/TCP error (esp-tls 0x8001)
 *
 * and this arrangement did NOT change that. The cause was external: nothing on
 * the network was answering for `headwaters.local` -- a workstation running
 * none of this code could not resolve it either, and `avahi-browse` saw no
 * mDNS services at all. If this error appears, check that the Headwaters box
 * is up and on the same network BEFORE looking at this file.
