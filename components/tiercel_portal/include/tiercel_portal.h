/*
 * Setup portal — phone-based provisioning.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Tiercel's only input is a rotary ring and a round touchscreen no wider
 * than a coaster. Entering a WPA2 passphrase on that means turning to
 * each character in turn, and an MQTT hostname is worse. It was built
 * and it does not work in practice.
 *
 * So the device raises its own Wi-Fi network, shows the name and
 * password on the glass, and serves a captive portal. The phone that
 * already has a keyboard does the typing.
 *
 * Once the panel is on the network and registered with Headwaters, the
 * rest of its configuration -- which lights it shows, what they are
 * called -- comes from the Overlook PWA, which has a real screen. This
 * portal deliberately handles only what is needed to GET there: Wi-Fi
 * and the broker.
