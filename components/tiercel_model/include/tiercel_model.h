/*
 * The data layer the UI observes.
 *
 * Every live value from the rig lands here, and the UI reads only from
 * here -- no screen touches MQTT. That boundary is what lets the whole UI
 * run against the mock source with no rig and no broker.
 *
 * WHY EVERY VALUE HAS A TIMESTAMP
 *
 * Nothing on this platform is retained. can-bridge.js publishes every
 * sensor topic WITHOUT the retain flag, so a freshly-booted display knows
 * nothing until the next periodic frame, and a module that dies leaves its
 * last reading sitting on screen looking perfectly current.
 *
 * So a value is never just a number: it is a number plus when it arrived.
 * Ask for it after its module's timeout and you get "no value", which the
 * UI renders as `--`. A stale number that looks live is worse than no
 * number -- someone acts on it.
 *
 * THREADING
 *
 * Setters are called from the MQTT task, getters from the LVGL task. Both
 * take an internal mutex; getters return by value so nothing holds a
 * pointer into the store.
