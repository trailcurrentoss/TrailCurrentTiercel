/*
 * SIZING, AND WHY THESE THREE NUMBERS ARE RELATED
 *
 * MSG_DATA_MAX was 512 and silently discarded real traffic:
 *
 *   W mqtt: dropping oversized message (27/674)
 *
 * 27 characters of topic is `local/config/relay_channels`, and its 674-byte
 * payload never reached the model -- so the relay channel map simply did not
 * exist on the panel, with nothing on screen to say why. The companion
 * `local/config/pdm_channels` is the same shape and will grow as channels are
 * added, so the limit needs headroom, not a number that just clears 674.
 *
 * The queue is `MSG_QUEUE_DEPTH * sizeof(msg_t)` of internal DRAM, which is
 * the scarce resource on this device -- scarce enough that the TLS buffers had
 * to be pushed into PSRAM. So the depth comes DOWN as the width goes up:
 *
 *   before   48 * (96 + 512 + 4)  = 29.4 KB
 *   now      24 * (96 + 1024 + 4) = 27.0 KB
 *
 * 24 is ample: the service task drains every 50 ms, and at the ~200 msg/s this
 * broker carries that is about 10 messages per pass.
 *
 * MQTT_RX_BUFFER must hold topic + payload + header or esp-mqtt fragments the
 * delivery, and fragments are dropped further down. It is therefore derived
 * from the two above rather than set independently.
 */
#define MSG_QUEUE_DEPTH 24
#define MSG_TOPIC_MAX   96
/* 2 KB on Tiercel, not Capstan's 1 KB: Playbill's transport status carries
 * the media URL and artwork URL, and a YouTube URL alone can run past 1 KB.
 * 24 x 2.1 KB is ~51 KB of PSRAM, which this board has 8 MB of. */

 * Headwaters (mbedtls + resolving headwaters.local), panicking the panel the
 * moment provisioning reaches the broker check. Set here rather than via
 * CONFIG_MQTT_TASK_STACK_SIZE so it cannot drift with a stale sdkconfig.
 * The stack is internal RAM; the connect log reports the headroom left.

/*
 * Configuration gets a queue of its own.
 *
 * The main queue discards its OLDEST entry when full, which is right for
 * sensor traffic -- a newer reading supersedes it -- and wrong for this
 * panel's controls and alarms. Those are retained and arrive exactly once per
 * connect, in the same burst as every other retained topic on the broker, so
 * under drop-oldest they were the likeliest thing to be discarded: nothing
 * supersedes them until the user next hits Save in the PWA. The symptom was
 * a dial that never picked up the alarms configured for it, while the log
 * showed nothing, because coalescing is logged at DEBUG.
 *
 * Nothing is ever discarded from this queue to make room. Four slots hold
 * one of each config topic with headroom; overflow is logged as an error.

/*
 * REPEATED STATES ARE DROPPED BEFORE THEY ARE QUEUED.
 *
 * Headwaters republishes every Switchback relay's state on every CAN status
 * frame whether or not it changed -- 8 relays, about 25 times a second, some
 * 200 messages a second of {"state":0}. Measured on the bench (2026-09-29)
 * that overran the 24-deep queue a few hundred times a minute, and the
 * message dropped could be the one change the user was waiting for, so a
 * device took seconds to show it had switched.
 *
 * So for the light and relay status topics only, a message whose payload
 * is identical to the last one seen on the same topic is discarded here, in
 * the event handler, before it costs a queue slot or a JSON parse. A change
 * always gets through at once. Those states never expire on this dial (see
 * the lights timeout in tiercel_model.c), so skipping repeats loses nothing;
 * every other topic still relies on repeats to stay fresh and is untouched.
 *
 * INCOMING ALWAYS WINS: the comparison is exact -- the stored topic and
 * payload, byte for byte -- so only a message identical to the last one on
 * its topic is ever skipped. Anything longer than a slot holds is never
 * filtered. A direct-mapped table keyed by a hash of the topic; a slot
 * collision just evicts, and the evicted topic's next message then passes,
 * which is always safe. In PSRAM: it is touched only from the MQTT task.
